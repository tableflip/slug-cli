# slug cli: slugify for filenames

Some people don't have standards when it comes to naming files.

**YOU ARE BETTER THAN THAT**

`slug` is a command line tool to bring the beautiful uniformity of `slugify` to the cli.
Grind your unruly filenames into `dasherized`, lowercased perfection.

`slug` renames files, turning nonsense into sense, like this:

```sh
slug Some_Client : BIG SCREEN layout.JPG
some-client-big-screen-layout.jpg
```
